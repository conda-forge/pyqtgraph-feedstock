  summary: Scientific Graphics and GUI Library for Python

  description: |
    PyQtGraph is a pure-python graphics and GUI library built on PyQt4 / 
    PySide and numpy. It is intended for use in mathematics / scientific / 
    engineering applications. Despite being written entirely in python, the
    library is very fast due to its heavy leverage of numpy for number
    crunching and Qt's GraphicsView framework for fast display.
